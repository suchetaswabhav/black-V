#  Black & Veatch Coding Challenge

## Requirements
#### Please document your code and provide steps to run and test.
As a next step in the interview process, we'd like you to complete a coding exercise. 
Your challenge is to implement a program in any language you choose that meets the following requirements:

* The program must be command-line executable.
* The program retrieves an array of User objects, each containing a user id and integer age, by making a `GET` request to the following endpoint & path:

 ```shell
ENDPOINT= https://tupleschallenge.blob.core.windows.net
PATH= /interview/age_data.json
 ```

* The program accounts and removes any bad data encountered while processing.
* The program outputs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a distinct age and the count of users with that age, delimited by a comma. (A touple in Node is an array of known length, whose values are of a known type.)
* The program should run as fast as possible on a modern multi-core processor.
* The program should be tested for all edges.
* Test coverage should be >80%.


## Completing the Exercise

We're expecting this exercise to take one-three hours, but you won't be penalized for spending more or less time on it. The idea is to keep the exercise fairly quick and to be respectful of your time. Naturally, the faster you get your solution over to us, the sooner we can evaluate it and progress through the interview process.

When you are ready for us to evaluate your solution, publish the code to a public repo and notify your primary contact. If you have any questions, please highlight them in your *README*. Weâ€™re looking forward to seeing your solution!



### Job Tech Stack

This position will be heavy node based, while this challenge accepts any language node is preferred. :) 

## Happy Coding :)
